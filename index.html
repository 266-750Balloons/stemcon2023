<h1>The Innards of Computing, Quick and Easy(ish)</h1>
<p>To many people, computers seem like absolute magic.</p>
<p>When more savvy people are asked about how these essential machines work, most would probably give a rehash of the following:</p>
<p><em>CPU computes the big stuff, GPU the graphics, Motherboard glues everything together, RAM is short-term storage</em></p>
<p>For the most part, that is true. When getting deeper, not as many people will think of the littler bits (I'll get into that later.).</p>
<p>This micro-course will go over the following concepts and (hopefully) bring them down to simple terms:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Transtitors</li>
    <li>Logic Gates</li>
    <li>Binary</li>
</ul>
<p>You can click on the sidebar to navigate to each section. I recommend going through them in order so you can play with the binary toy at the end.</p>
