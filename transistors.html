<p>First off. Transistors! What are they? Well, most simply, they are the fundamental building block of modern computers. Billions of very tiny ones fill the chips, even in the iPhones we hold in our hands.</p>

If both ends of the battery (or often, other transistors) is hooked up to two of the wire ends, the other end sends out electricity. If you disconnect the positive end of the battery, it doesn't come out. Basically like this:</p>
