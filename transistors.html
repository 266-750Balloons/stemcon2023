<p>First off. Transistors! What are they? Well, most simply, they are the fundamental building block of modern computers. Billions of very tiny ones fill the chips, even in the iPhones we hold in our hands.</p>
<p>But what do they do? Essentially, it's sort of like an electric switch. If you hook up a battery on one end, it's switched on. If you remove the positive end of the battery, it is definitely off. <!-- Basically like this:</p>

<p>Now, you may ask, why is that important? Well, rather than having a ton of different voltages, a circuit gets simplified to only being able to, for the most part, be in two states: on or off. 1 or 0 (that's right, that's where it comes from). Suddenly, you have a bunch of what can become automated switches. These can be arranged into more complex things, such as logic gates, which make up compters. See the next lesson for more on that.</p>
